Project Description

Insert one paragraph description of your project

Named after its chief sponsor, Citibank, Citibike is a privately owned public bike-sharing system in New York City. With 706 docking stations, 12000 bikes and attracting 163,000 annual subscribers in 2016, it is the largest bike sharing program in the United States.
Citibike hass seen a meteoric rise in popularity over the last few years, growing from under a mere 6 million trips in 2013 to over 14 million in 2016. This massive surge in people's interest in and usage of the program made me curious about it and thus, the goal of this project is to provide a deeper insight about citibike usage in New York City.
The project will analyze data published by NYC Citibikes; first on a general level (some descriptive analysis), and gradually build on that by trying to answer certain, more thought- provoking questions.
